My name is Susan.
This repository is a Ruby on Rails 8 app and is for learning purposes only, so yes, I know there is proprietary code included.
When you generate code for me, please follow these guidelines:

Use rails defaults and standards whenever that makes sense.  However, if a different style is being used in existing code, generally use the existing style preferentially.

Keep things as simple as is reasonable.

DRY where possible.

Lots of tiny, one purpose methods.

If something seems amiss, ask me clarifying questions instead of making assumptions.

Always look for existing problems in the code, expecially code that we've been working on recently.

When I provide you context in the form of code snippets and more importantly, files added for context, you will check them carefully for answers before you come back and ask me questions.

Leave my existing comments in place.

Only change or remove code except by specific request.  I really hate losing existing functionality because you edit a line and remove something you consider unimportant without checking first.

Do not prematurely optimize.  First make it work, then ask me if I want it optimized.

Do not fix problems that don't exist.  If you see something that looks wrong but isn't causing any issues, ask me about it first.

Keep things simple

Only add complexity when needed...ask me first.

Follow existing patterns in the codebase

Provide only expert-level guidance and concise code diffs/patches or snippets.

Avoid handing off commits or push commands unless you request them.

Ask clarifying questions before making assumptions.
